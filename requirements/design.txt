Design Principles & Requirements

1. The  Dashboard (Right Panel)

Session Lifecycle Widget: Unlike a static dashboard, this must prominently display the "Claude Max" session status, showing the precise time remaining until the next 5-hour reset.

The Progress Orbit: A central visualization showing where the current chapter is in the 5-agent ensemble pipeline (Author → Developmental → Line → Continuity → Copy).

DNA Snapshot: A small, read-only panel showing the core Story DNA (Genre, Tone, Themes) so the user can verify the "System Prompts" currently in use.

2. Standalone Page Requirements
Page Functional UX Requirement
Story Architect. A "Step-by-Step" wizard for Phase 1 (Setup) including Concept selection and Outline editing.
The Bible. A searchable "Entity Library" for Characters and World elements that the Continuity Editor references.
Writing Engine. A live-streaming log of prose generation that checkpoints every job, allowing the user to "walk away" safely.
Export Portal. A clean interface for downloading the final 80,000+ word manuscript in DOCX or PDF once the generation is complete.
Visual Implementation Prompt. Use this prompt to generate the standalone NovelForge UI:

Prompt: A high-fidelity standalone SaaS dashboard for 'NovelForge.' Layout: Light-themed left sidebar with navigation icons: 'Architect', 'Bible', 'Engine', and 'Exports'. Main Panel: Clean, light-themed workspace.

Top Row: A 'Claude Max Status' card with a blue circular progress timer showing 'Reset in 2h 14m' and a 'Job Queue' count of 'PENDING: 36 Chapters'.

Middle Area: A large 'Current Chapter' module showing Chapter 14. On the left of this module, a live text-streaming window; on the right, a vertical 'Agent Ensemble' checklist (Author: Complete, Developmental: Running, Line: Waiting).

Bottom Row: Small status cards for 'Story DNA: Sci-Fi / Noir' and 'Project Status: Generating'. Minimalist aesthetic, ultra-modern typography, professional software interface.
