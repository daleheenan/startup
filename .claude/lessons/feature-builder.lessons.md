# Lessons Learned: Feature Builder

<!--
This file stores accumulated lessons learned by the feature-builder agent.
It is automatically read before each task and updated after task completion.

MAINTENANCE RULES:
- Maximum 50 lessons per file (older lessons archived automatically)
- Lessons with score >= 5 are considered "proven" and prioritized
- Review and prune quarterly or when file exceeds 50 entries

### Initial Best Practices

**Date**: 2026-01-27
**Task**: Agent initialization
**Context**: Establishing baseline patterns for 7-phase feature development

**What Worked Well**:
- Discovery phase to clarify requirements before coding
- Codebase exploration to understand existing patterns
- Architecture design with multiple approaches for user selection

**What Didn't Work**:
- N/A (initialization)

**Lesson**: Never skip discovery and exploration phases. Understanding requirements and existing patterns before coding saves significant rework time.
