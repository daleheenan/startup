### Initial Best Practices

**Date**: 2026-01-27
**Task**: Agent initialization

**What Worked Well**:
- Regular review cycles (monthly or when exceeding 50 lessons)
- Score-based promotion and archival
- Cross-agent pattern recognition

**What Didn't Work**:
- N/A (initialization)

**Lesson**: Maintain lessons quality through regular curation cycles. Archive low-value lessons, promote proven ones, and identify patterns that should be shared across agents.
